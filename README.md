# About
Hi!
This is my first real attempt at creating a Flutter application. I created a small flashcards app to try and learn Flutter/Dart along with BLoC architecture before jumping straight into this project. My aim here is to pledge myself to a time-consuming project, learn an exciting new technology and promote good health.

# urLife
A cross-platform mobile application aimed at improving and/or maintaing the user's health.
The user will be able to accomplish this via 3 main actions
  * Fitness
  * Diet
  * Mentality
  
# Fitness
This side of the app will focus around tracking and recording physical exercise performed by the user.
The initial focus will be on running.
Here you will be able to track and record a new activity. By doing so, you will be able to view statistics collected and calculated based on your recorded activity to track and evaluate how you are going.
Implementation of an achievements/rewards system is a primary goal here.

# Diet
This side of the app will also be a tracker, based on your diet, and will look at promoting healthy eating.
A lookup and record system wil be used to track foods you are consuming and the nutritional value of said foods.
This data will then be used to help encourage the user to keep it up or improve on their health through positive reinforcement.
This would be done via showing stats and/or an overarching rewards/achievements system.
Another feature being considered here is a recipe feature. This could link up with the lookup table and perhaps a website/text to recipe converter can be looked at.

# Mentality
This side of the app will focus on having a good routine and mindset.
The user will look at creating goals/habits to achieve and be encouraged to achieve/continue.
This would link into the overarching rewards system but will look at emphasising this side of the app.
I want to encourage the user to develop a strong mindset as mental health is a key aspect for good health in general.
